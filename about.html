<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a Business Administrator. I have a master's degree in Project Management.</p>

<p>I have an urban garden, I love to harvest carrots, spinach and chard. I like to see each of the stages of the vegetables I plant.
I really enjoy teaching others about the things I learn to plant.</p>

<p> I love to drink coffee in the morning and at night before I go to sleep, otherwise I find it difficult to fall asleep.</p>

<p>I love spicy food and Mexican snacks.</p>
